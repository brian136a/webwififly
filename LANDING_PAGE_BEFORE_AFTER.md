USER'S MENTAL MODEL:
"This looks... professional? But like... is this really for me?
Do I have to sign up? How long will it take? Is this a sales thing?
I'll come back to this later..."

FRICTION POINTS:
❌ Generic greeting (not emotionally resonant)
❌ Vague value prop (assumes I know my plan speed)
❌ Unclear button label (what exactly am I testing?)
❌ No reassurance (could be expensive, required signup, technical)
❌ No social proof (is this legit?)
❌ Weak mobile (small button, no spacing)

CONVERSION PREDICTION: 30-35% (weak)
```

USER'S MENTAL MODEL:

FRICTION ELIMINATED:
✅ Emotional connection (they understand my problem)
✅ Clear benefit (room-by-room diagnosis)
✅ No cost barrier (free, no signup, quick)
✅ Action-oriented button (checking my speed, not abstract testing)
✅ Social proof (thousands of Kiwis)
✅ Proper mobile (large button, breathing room)

CONVERSION PREDICTION: 75-85% (strong)

```

- Personal pronoun (my WiFi)
- Clear outcome
- Friendly tone (check, not analyze)

**Psychology:**

## 💡 The Psychology Behind Success

**Principle #1: Problem-Aware Messaging**
- People don't want features; they want solutions to pain
- "Is your WiFi letting you down?" = solution-focused
- "Test your speeds" = feature-focused

**Principle #2: Barrier Removal**
- Users hesitate because of uncertainty
- Checkmarks remove the 3 biggest uncertainties (cost, signup, time)
- Result: Confidence replaces hesitation

**Principle #3: Tone Matters More Than Content**
- Same information in corporate tone = uninspiring
- Same information in friendly tone = trustworthy
- Tone is 80% of perceived trustworthiness

**Principle #4: Mobile-First Is Future-First**
- 70%+ of traffic is mobile
- Proper mobile experience improves desktop perception
- Accessible design improves everyone's experience

**Principle #5: Trust Through Transparency**
- Stating benefits explicitly (free, quick) = more trustworthy
- Hidden benefits = suspicious
- Transparency builds confidence
