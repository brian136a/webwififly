## 💬 Why These Changes Work

**Old problem:** Headline assumed users were frustrated. This excluded cautious/curious users.

**Solution:** Changed to question format that invites all users to explore.

---

**Old problem:** Users didn't know what happens next, creating hesitation.

**Solution:** Added explicit reassurance block explaining the process & removing objections.

---

**Old problem:** No trust signals; users worried about hidden costs.

**Solution:** Added minimal, honest trust signals (Free • No signup • Privacy-friendly).

---

**Old problem:** Mobile experience wasn't optimized; cards took up lots of space.

**Solution:** Icon inline with name saves space; responsive padding; better mobile layout.
