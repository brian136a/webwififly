## 🎯 Each Card Refined

### Card 1: William (Video)
```
BEFORE: "Video meetings are pixelated."
AFTER:  "Video calls get pixelated mid-meeting"
WHY:    More conversational; "mid-meeting" adds realism
```

### Card 2: Sarah (Gaming)
```
BEFORE: "Connection drops during gaming."
AFTER:  "Connection drops when gaming"
WHY:    Shorter; more direct; same meaning
```

### Card 3: James (Coverage)
```
BEFORE: "WiFi barely reaches the bedroom."
AFTER:  "WiFi doesn't reach the bedroom"
WHY:    More honest; "barely" is vague
```

### Card 4: Emma (Speed)
```
BEFORE: "Download speeds are painfully slow."
AFTER:  "Speeds are nowhere near what we pay for"
WHY:    Speaks to actual frustration (value mismatch)
```

### Card 5: Michael (Devices)
```
BEFORE: "Too many devices disconnect constantly."
AFTER:  "Devices keep disconnecting randomly"
WHY:    Removes blame; focuses on problem
```

### Card 6: Lisa (Upload)
```
BEFORE: "Upload speeds ruin my work from home."
AFTER:  "Upload speeds make remote work impossible"
WHY:    Dramatic but relatable; emphasizes impact
```

### Card 7: David (Zones)
```
BEFORE: "Inconsistent speeds throughout the day."
AFTER:  "WiFi is strong in one room, dead in another"
WHY:    Visual; "dead" is authentic Kiwi language
```

### Card 8: Rachel (Streaming)
```
BEFORE: "Provider claims speeds we don't actually get."
AFTER:  "YouTube constantly buffers and pauses"
WHY:    Specific platform; relatable; visual verbs
```

### Card 9: Tom (Household)
```
BEFORE: "Buffering ruins my streaming experience."
AFTER:  "WiFi slows down when everyone's home"
WHY:    Household angle; relatable situation
```
