### Section 4: Struggle Card Microcopy

#### Example 1: William (Video Conferencing)
| Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--|
| "Video meetings are pixelated." | "Video calls get pixelated mid-meeting" | Adds "mid-meeting" for realism; uses "calls" (Kiwi language) |

#### Example 2: Sarah (Gaming)
| Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--|
| "Connection drops during gaming." | "Connection drops when gaming" | Simpler; removes "during" (shorter) |

#### Example 3: James (Coverage)
| Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--|
| "WiFi barely reaches the bedroom." | "WiFi doesn't reach the bedroom" | More honest; "barely" is vague |

#### Example 4: Emma (Speed)
| Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--|
| "Download speeds are painfully slow." | "Speeds are nowhere near what we pay for" | Speaks to real frustration (value mismatch) |

#### Example 5: Michael (Devices)
| Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--|
| "Too many devices disconnect constantly." | "Devices keep disconnecting randomly" | Removes blame; focuses on problem |

#### Example 6: Lisa (Upload)
| Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--|
| "Upload speeds ruin my work from home." | "Upload speeds make remote work impossible" | More dramatic; relatable WFH context |

#### Example 7: David (Zones)
| Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--|
| "Inconsistent speeds throughout the day." | "WiFi is strong in one room, dead downstairs" | More visual; "dead" is authentic Kiwi language |

#### Example 8: Rachel (Streaming)
| Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--|
| "Provider claims speeds we don't actually get." | "YouTube constantly buffers and pauses" | More relatable; specific platform |

#### Example 9: Tom (Household)
| Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--|
| "Buffering ruins my streaming experience." | "WiFi slows down when everyone's home" | Household angle; relatable situation |

**Pattern:** All copy now sounds like a Kiwi talking to a friend, not a generic software description.

---

### Section 5: CTA Button

| Aspect | Before | After | Reason |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Text** | "Start Your Free Check" | "Check My WiFi Speed" | More specific, action-oriented |

| **Clarity** | Generic | Specific (what they're checking) | User knows exactly what happens |
| **Psychology** | "We're checking YOU" | "YOU are checking YOUR WiFi" | Ownership & agency |
| **Height** | Basic | `min-h-12` (48px) | WCAG AA compliant |
| **States** | Hover only | Hover + Active + Focus | Better accessibility |
| **Focus ring** | None | Cyan ring | Keyboard navigation support |
| **ARIA label** | Missing | "Start your free WiFi speed test" | Screen reader friendly |

| "Is there jargon?" | Explicitly addresses | "no jargon" |
| "What's the catch?" | Emphasizes free | "completely free" |

---
