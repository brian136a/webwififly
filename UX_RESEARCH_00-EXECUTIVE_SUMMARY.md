# WiFiFly UX Research Report — Page 0
## Executive Summary

**Date:** November 14, 2025  
**Report:** WiFiFly UX Research & User Experience Discovery Report  
**Focus:** NZ Homeowners & Small Business Owners

---

## The Headline Finding

WiFiFly has **excellent emotional foundations** but **critical data credibility issues** that will destroy user trust at the results stage.

**Bottom Line:** The app successfully builds trust and guides users through setup, but then shows impossible speed data (7,000+ Mbps for home internet), causing immediate loss of credibility.

---

## Three Pillars Assessment

### 1. ✅ EMOTIONAL JOURNEY (Strength)
- **Landing:** Clean, professional, clear value prop
- **Struggle:** Exceptional. Nine relatable personas validate user frustration
- **Setup:** Friendly tone, conversational questions, intelligent validation
- **Testing:** Clear progress, live feedback
- **Results:** Data overwhelms but visual design is strong

**Overall:** User feels understood and guided through most of the journey.

### 2. ❌ DATA CREDIBILITY (Critical Issue)
- Results show 7,000+ Mbps (impossible for home internet, max is ~1,000)
- Bars show 100% but percentages show 823%
- **Impact:** User immediately assumes app is broken or fake
- **Priority:** URGENT — Must fix before any beta testing

### 3. ⚠️ ACTIONABILITY (Weak)
- Results page shows data but doesn't guide next steps
- No clear "what do I do now?" after testing
- No transition to recommendations or paid solutions
- User leaves informed but not empowered

## Trust Arc

```
Landing:          LOW → Curiosity present but hesitant
Struggle:         HIGH → "They understand my problem"
Setup:            HIGH → "This feels professional and friendly"
Testing:          MEDIUM-HIGH → Progress is clear but some anxiety
Results:          MEDIUM → Confusion about data + no next steps
Exit:             MEDIUM → "Informed but not sure what to do"
```

## The Three Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Data Credibility Crisis ⚠️🔴
**Problem:** Test results display speeds like 7,726 Mbps (impossible)  
**User Impact:** "This app is broken" → Trust collapses  
**Fix Priority:** URGENT (before any beta testing)  
**Fix Effort:** Medium (backend data validation + display capping)

### Issue #2: Privacy Concern Unaddressed ⚠️🟠
**Problem:** App asks for ISP, plan speed, monthly cost without explaining why  
**User Impact:** Privacy-conscious users abandon; others proceed hesitantly  
**Fix Priority:** HIGH (quick win)  
**Fix Effort:** Low (add 1-2 lines of reassurance copy)

### Issue #3: No Clear Next Steps ⚠️🟠
**Problem:** Results shown but no guidance on implications or actions  
**User Impact:** User feels informed but not empowered  
**Fix Priority:** HIGH (improves conversion)  
**Fix Effort:** Medium (add contextual guidance section + CTA)

---

## Three Strongest Moments

### ✨ Moment #1: Struggle Cards
The 9 persona cards (William, Sarah, James, Emma, etc.) with specific WiFi problems create immediate emotional resonance. This is the **single most powerful UX element** in the app.

**Why it works:** Named people + relatable problems = "They understand ME"

### ✨ Moment #2: Conversational Microcopy
Questions like "Who is your provider please" instead of "Select ISP" and success messages saying "Great" instead of checkmarks make the interaction feel human.

**Why it works:** Every interaction feels like talking to a friend, not filling out a form

### ✨ Moment #3: Waterfall Chart
The % of plan visualization instantly shows which rooms are strong/weak without any explanation needed.

**Why it works:** Visual > textual explanation. User "gets it" immediately.

---

## Brand Tone Assessment: ✅ Excellent

The app's use of:
- **Kiwi language** ("loves helping Kiwis," casual tone)
- **Local context** (NZ$ currency, 19 NZ ISPs, Christchurch data)
- **Conversational voice** (questions, friendly warnings)
- **Intelligent validation** (context-aware feedback, not just "Invalid")

...creates a **genuinely compelling brand personality** that feels local, expert, and supportive.

**Competitive advantage:** Most speed test apps feel corporate and cold. WiFiFly feels like a knowledgeable friend. This is a significant strength.

## Conversion & Monetization Readiness

**Current State:** Partial

- ✅ Free test builds trust and provides data
- ⚠️ Results page confusion weakens conversion intent
- ⚠️ No introduction to premium solutions
- 🔄 User leaves with knowledge but no upsell path

**Fix Required Before Monetization:**
Users must understand what their results mean *before* you ask them to pay for solutions. Currently, they're confused about the data itself.
